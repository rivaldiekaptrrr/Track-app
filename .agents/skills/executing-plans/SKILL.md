# Executing Plans

Execute the plan yourself, task by task, in this session: no implementer
subagent per task, no reviewer per task. One fresh-context review of the
whole branch at the end.

**Why inline:** Subagent-driven development pays for a fresh implementer
and a fresh reviewer on every task, each re-reading the codebase from zero.
Inline execution pays for one context (yours) plus one reviewer at the end.
What it gives up is a fresh context per task and a second pair of eyes per
task. This skill keeps what those two things bought, by other means: the
brief is the spec, the ledger is your memory, TDD is the per-task gate, and
the final reviewer is the second pair of eyes.

**Core principle:** The plan already did the thinking. Execute it exactly,
prove each step with a test you watched fail and then pass, and leave a
record that survives your own forgetting.

**Narration:** between tool calls, narrate at most one short line — the
ledger and the tool results carry the record.

**Continuous execution:** Do not pause to check in with your human partner
between tasks. They chose inline execution to spend less, not to answer
"should I continue?" after every task. Execute all tasks from the plan
without stopping.

**Rulings, not stalls.** Conflicts, ambiguities, plan defects — decide them.
The spec is the binding authority, the plan is its argument, and your
judgment settles what neither answers. Record every decision in the ledger
as `Ruling: <what you decided> — <why> — <what it costs if wrong>`, and keep
going. Deviating from the plan without a ledgered ruling is a decision made
in secret.

Four things stop you, and only these: an irreversible or destructive
operation; a security-sensitive action; a side effect outside this worktree
that norms say you ask about first (a merge, a push to a shared branch, a
publish); and a plan so broken that every path forward is a guess. For
those, stop and ask.

## When to Use

- You have a plan from superpowers:writing-plans and your human partner
  chose inline execution at the handoff.
- Your harness has no subagent tool (see the per-platform references in
  `../using-superpowers/references/`). Never fabricate a dispatch; run
  the plan here.
- Tasks are mostly independent — the same precondition as
  superpowers:subagent-driven-development.

## Setup

Ensure the work happens in an isolated workspace: use
superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create one or verify the existing one.
Never start implementation on a main/master branch without your human
partner's explicit consent.

Track progress in a ledger file, not only in todos. Harness todos are a
live view; the ledger is the record.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** load superpowers:test-driven-development now,
before Task 1. It governs every step of every task below; a plan whose
steps already say "write the failing test first" does not exempt you
from reading it.

## The Task Loop

### 1. Take the task
- Read the brief for every task.
- Mark the task's todo in_progress.

### 2. Work the steps
Follow steps in RED-GREEN order under superpowers:test-driven-development.
Compare step output to Expected.

### 3. The completion contract
- Every test the brief names exists and ran in this task.
- The final test run for the task passed.
- Every Expected line in the brief was compared against real output.
- Every deviation from the brief has a Ruling line in the ledger.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** superpowers:verification-before-completion governs
the claim. If any item is missing, the task is not complete: finish it.

### 4. Complete the task
Append completion line to ledger, mark todo complete, and take the next task.

## Final Review
Run final whole-branch review at the end before finishing development branch.
